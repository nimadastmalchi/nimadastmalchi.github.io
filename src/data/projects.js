        "Concentrated Solar Power systems generate solar power by using mirrors or lenses to concentrate a large area of sunlight into a receiver. I designed, developed, and tested a C++ simulator for such systems. The above picture shows an image that is outputted by my simulation software. By using various laws of physics (reflection, refraction, snell's law, newton's law of cooling, heat capacity, etc) and ray-tracing from computer graphics, my program calculates a theoretical temperature and power output for a given CSP system to allow researchers analyze such systems before they are actually constructed. I published a research paper in UC Berkeley's 2020 'Think You?!' academic journal. Source code of simulator: https://github.com/nimadastmalchi/csp-ray-tracer"
