# A bit about me
I'm currently an undergrad at UCLA studying computer science, graduating in June 2023. I'm particularly interested in the intersection between computer science, math, and physics. I like working with multidisciplinary fields to solve real-world problems. In my projects, I often used concepts from physics and math to create cool programs that solve some issue. I'm also interested in web development (mostly backend and databases, but I've done some frontend too).

I really liked my operating systems, computer networking, programming languages, theoretical computer science, physics, and math courses. You can see all my coursework in the "Courses" tab.

As an undergrad, I've published and presented research in solar power simulation (C++). I've also had experience as a software engineer intern at Amazon and a information technology intern at California Department of Transportation.

I'm proficient in C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML/CSS. I've also worked with Git, GitHub, and Linux. For web dev, I know React.js and Node.js.
