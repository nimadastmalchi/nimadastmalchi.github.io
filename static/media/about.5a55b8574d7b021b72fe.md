During an internship at Amazon, Nima worked as a Software Development Engineer, contributing to the development of critical features for UI frameworks on Amazon devices. Notably, Nima's work on a high-performant multithreading library in C++ resulted in a significant 90% increase in app launch time. Nima also demonstrated proficiency in resolving complex multithreading issues using Google Mock and Catch2 testing frameworks and adhering to Agile development methodologies to meet project deadlines.

<br/>

In a previous role as an Information Technology Intern at Caltrans, Nima gained experience in imaging and encrypting computers as per organizational policies and procedures. He also resolved hardware and software issues while documenting the problem-solving process for future reference.

<br/>

Nima's research involvement includes a project focused on Solar Power Simulation, where he created a C++ program to simulate Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) systems. This involved utilizing ray tracing to compute power and temperature output. Nima presented his research at the HTCC conference at UC Irvine and published a paper in the Think You?! academic journal.

Nima has undertaken various projects, such as Scramboard, a highly available web app allowing users to collaboratively create pixel art on a shared canvas. He utilized React to design an interactive pixel board and dynamic pages, and employed Node.js to build and integrate APIs, connecting to a Firebase database for storing pixel and user information.

<br/>

In addition, Nima implemented a network router in C++, including handling Ethernet frames, ARP packets, and IPv4 packets with a static routing table. He successfully tested the router's functionality using Mininet to simulate virtual network traffic and topologies.

<br/>

Nima is proficient in programming languages such as C++, C, Java, and Python, and has expertise in technologies like Git, Linux, and React.
